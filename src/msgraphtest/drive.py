"""
drive.py — SharePoint document library (drive) operations via Microsoft Graph.

All functions operate against a specific drive identified by SHAREPOINT_DRIVE_ID.
The site is identified by SHAREPOINT_SITE_ID.

Covered operations:
    list_drive_items    — list the children of a folder (default: root)
    download_file       — download a drive item to a local path
    upload_file         — upload a local file to the drive
    read_file_content   — return the text content of a drive item
    write_file_content  — overwrite a drive item with new text content
